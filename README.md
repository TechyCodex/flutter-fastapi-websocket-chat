# 💬 Flutter + FastAPI Real-Time Chat App

A beginner-friendly real-time chat application built using **Flutter** (frontend) and **FastAPI** (backend) with **WebSocket** communication.
Great for learning how WebSockets work in full-stack apps!

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This project is designed for **educational purposes** — to help you understand how:

* Flutter connects to a WebSocket server
* FastAPI handles real-time communication using WebSocket
* Data flows between client and server
* You can build chat UIs dynamically in Flutter

---

## 🚀 Features

* 🔁 Real-time messaging using WebSockets
* 👤 Simple username entry before chat
* 📩 Message broadcasting to all connected users
* 🧭 UI distinguishes between sender and receiver
* 🕒 Timestamp displayed with each message
* 📚 Minimal and readable code for easy learning

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Layer    | Technology       |
| -------- | ---------------- |
| Frontend | Flutter (Dart)   |
| Backend  | FastAPI (Python) |
| Protocol | WebSockets       |

## ▶️ Getting Started

### 📡 Start Backend (FastAPI)

```bash
cd server
pip install fastapi uvicorn
uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080
```

### 📱 Start Frontend (Flutter)

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

Make sure your **Flutter app points to the correct IP** (`ws://<your-ip>:8080/ws`).

---

## 💬 How It Works

1. User enters their name and joins the chat.
2. Flutter connects to FastAPI server via WebSocket.
3. Messages are sent in format: `username: message`.
4. FastAPI receives and rebroadcasts the message to all clients.
5. Flutter clients update their UI in real-time with timestamps.
